    <h1 class="h4 mb-3">About Ephemeral Notes</h1>
  <p class="text-muted">Ephemeral Notes is a lightweight, self-hostable web application for creating short-lived, unguessable notes intended for secure, ephemeral sharing.</p>

    <h2 class="h6 mt-3">Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create notes that automatically expire after a configurable time-to-live (TTL).</li>
      <li>Optional password protection for viewing a note.</li>
      <li>Optional Markdown formatting with safe sanitization to prevent XSS.</li>
      <li>Optional "burn after view" that deletes a note on first successful view.</li>
      <li>Lightweight creation history and total counts (metadata only â€” note contents are not stored in history).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h6 mt-3">Security and Privacy</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">Notes are stored in Redis with a time-to-live and are not retained beyond their configured expiration. When the "burn after view" option is used, the note is removed immediately after a successful view (server-side). Passwords (if used) are verified on the server and are not stored in plaintext.</p>
